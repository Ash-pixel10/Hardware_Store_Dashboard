I choose Atlik Hardware Store datasets for Analysis and visualization. This dashboard encapsulates key performance indicators and offers a deep insight into the business's performance, leveraging advanced analytics and visualization techniques.

Here are some highlights of the dashboard's features and functionalities:

1️⃣ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): I designed and implemented a set of essential KPIs that include Total Revenue, Total Sales Quantity, Revenue by Market, and Top 5 Products and Customers. These KPIs provide a holistic view of the store's performance and customer behavior.

2️⃣ Profit Analysis: The dashboard facilitates a comprehensive profit analysis by market, allowing stakeholders to identify lucrative markets and allocate resources effectively. Additionally, it incorporates Profit Margin calculations, Percentage Profit Contribution, and Revenue Trend analysis to enable informed decision-making.

3️⃣ Performance Analysis: I developed an intuitive performance analysis section that categorizes the data by market and zones. This segmentation helps in identifying geographical strengths and weaknesses, enabling effective strategic planning and targeted marketing efforts.

4️⃣ Data Filtering: The dashboard offers flexible data filtering options, empowering users to narrow down their analysis to specific years and months. This feature facilitates dynamic exploration and comparison of performance trends over time.

5️⃣ Figma: The dashboard background design was done in figma. 

Tools Used: PowerBI,Figma and MySQL.
